      <p>These pages contain many different adventures you can go on as you journey under the sea. From time to time as you read along, you will be asked to make a choice. Your choice may lead to success or disaster! The adventures you take are a result of your choice. You are responsible because you choose! Remember—you cannot go back! Think carefully before you make a move! One mistake can be your last&#8230; or it may lead you to fame and fortune!</p>

      <p>You are an underwater explorer. You are leaving to explore the deepest oceans. You must find the lost city of Atlantis. This is your most challenging assignment.</p>
      <p>It is morning and the sun pushes up on the horizon. The sea is calm. You climb into the narrow pilot's compartment of the underwater vessel Seeker with your special gear. The crew of the research vessel Maray screws down the hatch clamps. Now begins the plunge into the depths of the ocean. The Seeker crew begins lowering by a strong, but thin cable. Within minutes, you are so deep in the ocean that little light filters down to you. The silence is eerie as the Seeker slips deeper and deeper. You peer out the thick glass porthole and see fish drifting past, sometimes stopping to look at you—an intruder from another world.</p>
      <p>Now the cable attaching you to Maray is extended almost to its limit. You have come to rest on a ledge near the canyon in the ocean floor that supposedly leads to the lost city of Atlantis.</p>
      <p>You have a special sea suit that will protect you from the intense pressure of the deep if you choose to walk about on the sea bottom. You can cut loose from the cable if you wish because the Seeker is self-propelled. You are now in another world.</p>
      <choice dest="pg-6">You decide to explore the ledge where the Seeker has come to rest&#8230;</choice>
      <choice dest="pg-5">You decide to cut loose from the Maray and dive with the Seeker into the canyon in the ocean floor&#8230;</choice>
    </page>
    <page ref="pg-5">
      <p>You radio a status report to the Moray and tell them that you are going to cast off from the line and descend under your own power. Your plan is approved and you cast off your line. Now you are on your own. The Seeker slips noiselessly into the undersea canyon.</p>
      <p>As you drop into the canyon, you turn on the Seeker's powerful searchlight. Straight ahead is a dark wall covered with a strange type of barnacle growth. To the left (port) side you see what appears to be a grotto. The entrance is perfectly round, as if it had been cut by human hands.</p>
      <p>Lantern fish give off a pale, greenish light. To the right (starboard) side of the Seeker you see bubbles rising steadily from the floor of the canyon.</p>
      <choice dest="pg-8">You decide to investigate the bubbles&#8230;</choice>
      <choice dest="pg-9">You decide to investigate the grotto with the round entrance&#8230;</choice>

    <page ref="pg-6">
      <p>Your sea suit will protect you from the intense pressures of the deep. It is a tight fit and takes you some time to put it on. Finally you slip from the airlock of the Seeker and stand on the ocean floor. It is a strange and marvelous world where your every move isslowed down. You begin to explore with your special hand-held searchlight. You examine the ledge by the canyon.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, a school of bright yellow angel fish dart by, almost brushing you. What made them move so fast? Are they being chased?</p>
      <p>Then you see it. The Seeker is in the grips of a huge sea monster. It is similar to a squid, but it is enormous. The Seeker is just a toy in its long, powerful tentacles. You seek shelter behind a rock formation. You know the spear gun you carry will be useless against this monster. It looks asthough it will destroy the Seeker. Fish of allsizes huddle with you in an attempt to escape the monster.</p>
      <choice dest="pg-10">You stay hidden close to the Seeker&#8230;</choice>

    <page ref="pg-8">
      <p>Carefully, you maneuver the Seeker between the walls of the canyon.</p>
      <p>On the floor of the canyon, you discover a large round hole out of which flow the large bubbles. The Seeker is equipped with scientific equipment to analyze the bubbles. It also has sonar equipment that can measure the depth of any hole.</p>
      <choice dest="pg-11">You decide to analyze the bubbles&#8230;</choice>
      <choice dest="pg-15">You decide to take sonar readings&#8230;</choice>
    </page>
    <page ref="pg-9">
      <p>You pilot the Seeker through the rounded entrance to the grotto. Once inside, your searchlight picks up what appear to be docks and piers along the grotto walls. The Seeker's searchlight is not very powerful. However, you do have a special laser light which would light up the grotto like daylight. Unfortunately, the laser light can only be used twice for very short periods before it must be recharged aboard the Maray, now more than 2,000 feet above you on the surface.</p>
      <choice dest="pg-16">You decide to use the laser light&#8230;</choice>
      <choice dest="pg-14">You decide to cruise further into the grotto&#8230;</choice>

    <page ref="pg-10">
      <p>The giant squid tosses and turnsthe Seeker, but finally the creature growstired of its new game and jets off with an enormous squirt of water. You now are free to leave your hiding place and examine the Seeker for damage.</p>
      <p>To your dismay, the airlock entrance has been jammed shut. You are locked out of the Seeker. The crew of the Maray, however, suspected trouble when you did not respond to a routine radio check and they are now lowering an escape platform to you. Once on the platform, you radio them to start the slow pull to the surface. To avoid the bends—rapid expansion of nitrogen bubbles in your blood—they will have to bring you up very slowly.</p>
      <p>Just as the platform begins to move, the giant squid suddenly returns as if from nowhere. It is headed directly at you.</p>
      <choice dest="pg-17">You decide to fight the squid with yourspear gun, hoping to scare it off&#8230;</choice>
      <choice dest="pg-18">You decide to signal Maray to pull you up at top speed, knowing you will get the bends&#8230;</choice>
    </page>
    <page ref="pg-11">
      <p>You squeeze into your sea suit and, outside the Seeker, you use special equipment to analyze the bubbles. As you work, you clumsily knock against the valve that dumpsthe compressed air necessary to make the Seeker rise to the surface. There is nothing to be done about it; so you continue to analyze the bubbles. They contain a high percentage of oxygen and no poisonous gases. Perhaps they are coming from some area below the sea where human-type beings can live and breathe. Perhaps they are coming from Atlantis.</p>
      <p>You wonder whether you should try the Seeker's drilling arm to enlarge the source of the bubbles so you can explore it with the Seeker. But you are also very worried about the Seeker's loss of rising capability. You might also be able to trap the bubbles and use them to raise the Seeker.</p>
      <choice dest="pg-24">You try to collect the bubbles coming from the hole to fill the tanks of the Seeker&#8230;</choice>
      <choice dest="pg-22">You decide to drill&#8230;</choice>

    <page ref="pg-12">
      <p>Moving cautiously, you climb up the sides of the canyon hoping to reach the ocean floor. You leave the Seekerin the grips of the giantsquid. Your plan is to signal for help with a dye marker that will float to the surface and make a bright yellow patch in the water. The crewmen above have been instructed to watch for such emergency signals. They will send help.</p>
      <p>Once you reach the ledge above the canyon and feel slightiy safer, you see the most feared of all sea creatures— a huge shark. It begins to circle towards you and you know that you are its target. You wonder whether you should fire your emergency propulsion charge that will send you rapidly to the surface. The shark is fast; he might catch you anyway. You also know that you will get the bends from the rapid rise to the surface.</p>
      <choice dest="pg-21">You decide to fire the special propulsion charge to get to the surface&#8230;</choice>
      <choice dest="pg-19">You decide to wait quietly hoping that the shark will go away&#8230;</choice>
    </page>
    <page ref="pg-14">
      <p>You cruise silently into the grotto. Its roof seems to slope upward and you follow the slope. The depth finder shows that you are rising quite rapidly. Perhaps you will reach the surface and open air. Then the roof of the grotto stops sloping upward. Before you is a perfectly round metallic hatch made of a metal that you have never seen before. With the mechanical arm of the Seeker you try to open the hatch. It will not open. You begin to send radio signals at the door hoping to make contact on the other side.</p>
      <choice dest="pg-26">You decide to blow the hatch open with an explosive charge&#8230;</choice>
      <choice dest="pg-28">You decide to continue transmitting radio communicationsthrough the hatch&#8230;</choice>
    </page>
    <page ref="pg-15">
      <p>You maneuver the Seeker next to the hole and begin to take sonar readings to determine the depth of the hole. To your amazement, the sonar readings indicate that the hole is extraordinarily deep— it might reach the center of the earth!</p>
      <p>What lies down there? Where are the bubbles coming from? Is Atlantis beneath you?</p>
      <p>Then you notice a disturbing reading on your instruments; a mild earthquake has occurred. The Seeker is not damaged, but the earthquake could set up a tsunami wave on the surface causing the Moray to leave forsafer areas. It might be dangerous not to get back to the surface and leave with the Moray. On the other hand, you are perhaps on the verge of one of the world's greatest discoveries.</p>
      <choice dest="pg-23">You decide to descend into the hole&#8230;</choice>
      <choice dest="pg-27">You decide to return to the surface&#8230;</choice>
    </page>
    <page ref="pg-16">
      <p>The beam from the laser light illuminates the entire grotto. Far back on the floor of the grotto is a submarine! Cautiously, you maneuver the Seeker closer. You identify it asthe submarine that mysteriously disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle almost a year before. The Bermuda Triangle is more than 2000 miles away.</p>
      <p>The submarine is apparently not damaged, but it is covered with a slimy algae. Beautiful fish swim around it as though it is their own special prize. Then you notice that the main hatch is free of algae!</p>
      <choice dest="pg-29">You decide to try to enter the submarine&#8230;</choice>
      <choice dest="pg-31">You decide to cruise on through the grotto&#8230;</choice>

    <page ref="pg-17">
      <p>With a rush of water, the giant squid attacks you. Two 20 foot tentacles with their pulsing suction cups reach out trying to ensnare you. You dive off the platform and rapidly fire two of your spears. They strike the squid close to its two monstrous eyes. But the squid keeps on coming.</p>
      <p>One of the tentacles wraps around your diving helmet and ruptures the seal to your suit. You fire your last spear hoping to hit the monster in a vulnerable spot. Water is beginning to trickle into your suit. You signal the Maray to haul you up fast— "Emergency Hoist." You must have hit the squid. It floats away writhing and thrashing. You think you're about to black out.</p>
      <p>You wake up on the deck of the Moray and are quickly rushed to the decompression chambers to ward off the effect of the bends. In a few days you are better and start to worry about diving into the abyss again.</p>
      <choice dest="pg-32">You decide to quit the expedition now&#8230;</choice>
      <choice dest="pg-33">You decide to go back down to the deep&#8230;</choice>
    </page>
    <page ref="pg-18">
      <p>As they begin the rapid hauling, you lose your ability to function in the deep. You start to get dizzy and your arms and legs feel weak. You lose your hold on the platform and drift in the water exhausted. Then you see a dolphin heading toward you. You know that these marvelous mammals sometimes help people in trouble. Will it help you?</p>
      <choice dest="pg-34">You try to get help from the dolphin&#8230;</choice>
      <choice dest="pg-37">You decide to carry on alone swimming to the surface&#8230;</choice>
    </page>
    <page ref="pg-19">
      <p>You wait for the shark to go away. But then you notice other sharks coming to join in the hunt. They circle you, coming closer and faster each time. It is too late. There is no escape!</p>
      <p style="bold">The End</p>
      <choice dest="pg-2">Begin again?</choice>
    </page>
    <page ref="pg-21">
      <p>You fire the special propulsion charge and zoom upward through the water, frightening schools of fish as you go. You become dizzy and lose track of where you are. The world seems upside down. The shark is nowhere around, you hope. Then you break through to the surface floating about a half mile from the Maray.</p>
      <p>The lookouts spot you in the water and quickly rescue you. Unfortunately, the rapid ascent has given you a bad case of the bends. It takes a long time to decompress. And when you are finally all right, the ship's doctor informs you that your underwater days are over. Someone else will have to find Atlantis.</p>
      <p style="bold">The End</p>

    <page ref="pg-22">
      <p>As you begin to drill, the stream of bubbles increases.</p>
      <p>The stream of bubbles is strong enough now to ruffle the surface of the sea. You could try to surface now and locate the exact position of the bubble area. Then you could make plans with the scientists aboard the Moray about what to do next. But also, you could simply explore the hole with the Seeker to determine the source of the bubbles now! There is great risk in entering the hole, but it could lead to the source of the bubbles and maybe to Atlantis.</p>
      <choice dest="pg-38">You explore&#8230;</choice>
      <choice dest="pg-35">You try to surface&#8230;</choice>
    </page>
    <page ref="pg-23">
      <p>Now is the time for decision. You check all the controls of the Seeker, grit your teeth, and push the control column into the deep dive position. Down, down you go where no person has ever ventured. The Seeker is built for deep, deep dives, but you are descending rapidly mile after mile into the deep. The pressure is intense, the darkness is complete, and the depth guage indicates an incredible 15 miles. You quickly reverse the control column. Warning lights flare up on your control panel; they show that gravitational forces are now stronger than the Seeker's propulsion motors. You have passed the point of no return and your journey downward will continue in utter darkness until the water pressure is too great for the Seeker. This is the final voyage.</p>
      <p style="bold">The End</p>
      <choice dest="pg-2">Begin again?</choice>
    </page>
    <page ref="pg-24">
      <p>You are able to capture the bubbling gases and fill the tanks of the Seeker, enough to allow it to rise. Slowly, the Seeker rises out of the canyon, scattering schools of brightly colored fish, and brushing past underwater plants that wave like palm trees in a wind. Just as you reach the ledge at the top of the canyon, you see what appears to be an old road! Rocks along its side seem to be guard rails. Could this be a path that leads to the lost city of Atlantis? You anchor the Seeker and prepare to investigate more closely.</p>
      <p>Your sea suit will protect you from the intense pressures of the deep. It is a tight fit and takes you some time to put it on. Finally you slip from the airlock of the Seeker and stand on the ocean floor. It is a strange and marvelous world where your every move isslowed down.

    <page ref="pg-26">
      <p>The only way to get beyond the door isto blast it away, or so you believe. The Seeker's laser cannon is powerful and you position the Seeker to fire. Pushing the fire button, you send a powerful beam at the hatch. Nothing happens. Then you advance the cannon control to full emergency force. Again you push the button and the beam dissolves the hatch instantly. A flood ofsea water rushesinto the giant hole, carrying you with it into an air-filled cavern beyond. The water fills the cavern with speed and explosive force. You see several people scurrying towards escape hatches. IT IS TOO LATE! You did the wrong thing.</p>
      <p style="bold">The End</p>

    <page ref="pg-27">
      <p>Deciding to return to the surface, you direct the Seeker cautiously back along the side of the canyon in the ocean floor. Without warning, the Seekeris gripped in a powerful current thatsweeps it toward a grotto. Once in the grotto, the current carries you to what appears to be a large metal door. It swings open and the Seeker is swept inside. The door closes, the water in the grotto drains away, and you step out into a chamber that you decide must be made by human hands.</p>
      <p>A door opens in the wall, two people dressed in simple clothes come towards you. One of them says, "Welcome to Atlantis. We have been expecting you."</p>
      <p>What a discovery! You have found the lost continent and its civilization. The two people tell you that although citizens of Atlantis occasionally journey to the upper world, anyone who happens upon Atlantis is never permitted to leave. The Atlanteans are not cruel but fear discovery of their world.</p>
      <p>They want you to follow them and you agree. But you have another thought. Perhaps you could blast your way out of the chamber with the Seeker's laser cannon.</p>
      <choice dest="pg-39">You decide to follow the people and join the Atlantean society&#8230;</choice>

    <page ref="pg-28">
      <p>The radio transmissions seem to be failing, and you grow tired of sending signals through the closed door. You are just about to give up when the doorsuddenly swings open revealing behind it a cavern with another door. You enter the cavern cautiously and receive a radio signal in English. It tells you that you are welcome here, but that once you enter this place, you may never return to the world above. It is up to you to decide.</p>
      <choice dest="pg-41">You decide to go on and investigate what might be Atlantis&#8230;</choice>

      <p>The submarine is indeed mysterious. You now have on your sea suit and you open the hatch on the conning tower and enter the sub. It is amazingly clean and in order. There are no signs of life, but there are also no signs ofstruggle or trouble. In the control room, you see a piece of mystifying equipment that just doesn't belong on this sub.</p>
      <p>A voice begins telling you that, thousands of years ago, the leaders of Atlantis realized that their continent was slipping into the sea. They discovered a large underground cavern and built new forms of living quarters for their people. Later when Atlantis was deep beneath the ocean, some of their scientists discovered and perfected an operation enabling them to breathe under water.</p>
      <p>The voice, which sounds friendly, also tells you that there are two groups in Atlantis. One group is good and the other is evil. The voice invites you to enter the world of Atlantis and gives directions and instructions to a secret passageway to the underwater city.</p>
      <p>As you follow directions, you spy an unbelievable underwater craft with several people in it. It must be an Atlantean ship, but are the people good or evil? Do they know of the secret passageway?</p>
      <choice dest="pg-43">You hurry in, trying to reach the secret passageway without being seen&#8230;</choice>
      <choice dest="pg-44">You rush back to the Seeker trying to escape danger&#8230;</choice>

    <page ref="pg-31">
      <p>You cruise through the grotto past the wreck of the submarine and then you spot another ship wreck. And then another. They, too, are covered with algae, but they appear undamaged. Maybe people from Atlantis capture ships in the Bermuda Triangle and bring them here. Then you see another ship, but this one is a three-masted schooner of the type used in the early 1800s. Its rigging isfestooned with algae, and fish swim lazily around its mast.</p>
      <p>Your curiosity captures you and you put on your sea suit. Leaving the Seeker, you move towards the old sailing ship. Suddenly a thirteen-foot long deadly poisonous sea snake strikes from behind the forward cabin and bites you in the soft flesh between the fingers of your right hand. There is no antidote to the deadly poison.</p>

      <p>With great sorrow, you decide that it is wisest to leave the expedition now. You can't risk returning to the great depths below. So, you reluctantly return to the United States.</p>
      <p>You are invited to tell of your adventures on several major television shows. While on one such show, a special news flash announces to the world the discovery of Atlantis. You regret your decision, but you didn't really have a choice. Did you?</p>

      <p>You can't resist the adventure beneath the sea. You must go down again, and after several weeks of rest, you enter the Seeker and slip quickly into the deep. You bring the Seeker to rest by the great canyon in the ocean bottom and, wearing your special suit, you venture out into the depths. There are no signs of the giant squid and you feel safe.</p>
      <p>Rounding a rock formation, you come upon the wreck of an ancient Greek ship. How strange to find this ship, intact, so far below the surface. What brought it here? Was it visiting Atlantis before the lost continent slipped beneath the sea?</p>
      <p>You take pictures and make notes in your special undersea book. Maybe this ancient ship hides the secret to Atlantis.</p>

In a short time, you break through to the surface. You blink in the brightsun. The Maray is nowhere in sight. You are lost far at sea</p>
      <p>The dolphin dives beneath the surface with you still clinging to him. He speeds off and within 20 minutes you are next to the Moray. The dolphin must have heard the Moray's engine noises underneath the water.</p>
      <p>Once aboard, everyone congratulates you on your escape. You will go down again, but the thought keeps haunting you: What if your luck has run out?</p>

      <p>You suddenly realize the stream of bubbles is powerful enough to raise the Seeker. You guide the Seeker into the bubble stream and it heads towards the surface. As you swirl upward, you begin to notice increasing amounts of brown kelp— seaweed. Near the surface, you become entangled in the seaweed. The instruments in the Seeker indicate that the propellers and the steering mechanisms will not work.</p>
      <p>You put on your sea suit and go out to see what can be done. Once outside in the kelp, you realize that you can't free the Seeker. You start to swim for the surface but then you are soon completely stuck in the clinging seaweed. You are trapped and unable to go forward or return to the Seeker.</p>

      <p>Then a large fish— ugly, lumpy, puffed up, and covered with black and white markings swims towards you. Its bulging eyes fasten on you. It is a big-mouthed grouper, a fish which does not bother to bite its victims, butsimply swallowsthem whole.</p>

      <p>You decide to guide the Seeker into the new passageway to the bubble source. Suddenly the Seeker is swept downward as if pulled by a giant magnet. You lose consciousness. When you awake, you are in a well-lighted and comfortable room. Three people are standing close to you. They look normal and appear to be friendly.</p>
      <p>The middle one speaks. "You are in the nether region of Atlantis. Thisis a visitors'reception room. If you wish to come into the city of Atlantis, then follow us; but you may never return to your world. If you wish to leave now, we will escort you safely to the surface. It is your choice.

      <p>You are led to a room. The floors are a rich marble. The walls glow. The ceiling is like being inside a diamond looking through the many facets.</p>
      <p>A person who immediately commands respect beckons you with firmness and kindness to come to her.</p>
      <p>"Welcome to Atlantis. Thousands of years ago we learned that we were about to slip into the sea. Our people prepared for the calamity by building a new city inside an extinct volcano. We have lived here in peace and harmony ever since. We have no sunlight, nor stars to gaze at, but we have other spaces to meditate upon."</p>
      <p>She tells you about a group of people called the Nodoors. If you wish, you can live with them, but you cannot leave Atlantis.</p>
      <p>A bearded man is to be your escort. Atlantis is a beautiful city. Buildings merge one into another, colors radiate light, and coral branches fill courtyards. There is a sense of well-being and peace.</p>
      <p>It would be pleasant here, but you don't want to be a prisoner. Maybe there would be a better chance to escape if you join the Nodoors. You ask your guide about them.</p>
      <p>"Oh, we believe they are dangerous, but we don't really know. They live in the center of the old volcano. If you wish, I can take you there."</p>

Their civilization is technologically very advanced and a sensing mechanism tells them that you are about to use your laser cannon. They quickly fire a special beam at the Seeker that makes all its functions stop. You are now powerlessto escape. They walk up calmly to the Seeker and tell you to come with them to Atlantis.</p>

      <p>You are greeted by a group of people who look like ordinary human beings except that there are gill-like slits on their necks. Their bare feet have skin between the toes forming a web. They order you to put on your sea suit, pull you quickly from the Seeker, and lead you towards their city. On the way they show you the zoo where there are animals from the world above the sea. There is a glass-like cage surrounding them filled with air, allowing them to live below the sea.</p>

The scientists aboard the Maray had mentioned the possibilities of finding signs of the ancient civilization, such asroads. You must investigate.</p>
      <p>Your sea suit will protect you from the intense pressures of the deep. It is a tight fit and takes you some time to put it on. Finally you slip from the airlock of the Seeker and stand on the ocean floor. It is a strange and marvelous world where your every move isslowed down. You begin to explore with your special hand-held searchlight. You examine the ledge by the canyon.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, a school of bright yellow angel fish dart by, almost brushing you. What made them move so fast? Are they being chased?</p>
      <p>Then you see it. The Seeker is in the grips of a huge sea monster. It is similar to a squid, but it is enormous. The Seeker is just a toy in its long, powerful tentacles.

      <p>You escape being seen by the submarine craft. Following the instructions you enter a passageway. At the end of the passageway is an airlock door and beyond it an incredibly large air-filled cavern. Perhaps it is the inside of an extinct volcano.</p>
      <p>The land is pleasant, although strange to your experience. A soft substance covers the ground. It seems to be alive. You can't tell. A gentle light comes from the sides of this huge cavern. It reminds you of early morning light just before the sun rises.</p>
      <p>A group of people approach you with friendly gestures. They are wearing simple clothes much like the clothes people wore in ancient Greece. They are kind and generous. You remove your diving suit to find that the air is good to breathe.</p>
      <p>These people speak a language that is unknown to you, but one of them acts as an interpreter. You find out that this is Atlantis. They tell you it is governed by a man who is greedy, selfish, and dangerous. The people are like slaves. Everyone is unhappy except a few who serve the ruler as his lieutenants.

      <p>A door leads to a smaller cabin. On a table near the rear of this cabin is a golden box. You open it and find the remains of a map. It does not show Atlantis. It shows that the ship was searching for a hole that leads to the center of the earth!</p>
      <p>You return to the Seeker and use the map to locate this incredible shaft to the center of the earth. Using some guesswork to interpret the map, you discover the tunnel opening, which appears to be roughly 100 feet in diameter. The sonar readings indicate the hole has no bottom.</p>

The Seeker is prepared for the second dive, but suddenly the wind rises and the sea kicks up into furious waves that crash over the deck of the Maray. All hands rush to prepare for hurricane force winds. There is no chance for the second dive to begin. All day and all night the Maray pitches on the stormy sea.</p>
      <p>The next morning the wind has died and the sky clear. You are now ready to dive again.</p>
      <p>Again the Seeker is lowered over the side of the Maray and slipsinto the ocean. Fish swim by peering cautiously at you in your metal shell. The sunlight fades as you descend into the abyss. You are headed for the giant canyon below that might lead to Atlantis. When you reach the canyon you switch on the Seeker's searchlight. Immediately you spot the round hole that appears to be made by intelligent beings. Perhaps it leads to Atlantis.</p>
      <p>You pilot the Seeker through the rounded entrance to the grotto. Once inside, your searchlight picks up what appear to be docks and piers along the grotto walls. The Seeker's searchlight is not very powerful. However, you do have a special laser light which would light up the grotto like daylight. Unfortunately, the laser light can only be used twice for very short periods before it must be recharged aboard the Maray, now more than 2,000 feet above you on the surface.</p>

      <p>Poised over the spot you so carefully marked on the charts, you dive down in the Seeker. Again you find the hidden grotto and the round metal panel.</p>

      <p>Escape will be difficult, but you decide that you must get away from these people. The best plan is to tell them that you want to accept their offer to spy on the Atlanteans. They are of course happy when you tell them that you will work for them. "You see, the Atlanteans are jealous of us. We must be on our guard or else they will invade our area and capture us." You don't believe the Atlanteans are at all jealous of the Nodoors, but you won't argue. They take you back to the outskirts of their area, and you leave to join the Atlanteans. Once back with the Atlanteans, you ask them to allow you to live with them. You know that you will never be allowed to leave their underwater world, but there is always the hope for escape.

      <p>You argue with yourself for weeks. Then you decide to go back to Atlantis. You are in such a hurry to return that you hire a small, fast hydrofoil craft to take you to the spot in the ocean where Atlantis is. Once reaching the spot, you intend to make a dive with just scuba gear! You know a 2000 foot dive is impossible. But you don't care; you feel you must make the attempt.</p>
      <p>A storm rips the sea for six days and when it clears you prepare to dive. Just as you slip into the water, you look up into the sky and high above the clouds you see the sparkling city of Atlantis. No dive is necessary.</p>

      <p>During the night, you are awakened by the sound of voices talking quietly. Listening, you realize that a group of Nodoors is planning an escape. They want to join the Atlanteans. They believe that life in Atlantis can be better for them. You join them and listen to the stories of fear and darkness. They seek light and friendship. It sounds simple, but nothing is easy.</p>
      <p>Suddenly the door bursts open. Three guards armed with special weapons rush in. They fire the weapons and in a flash of brilliant light you and your companions are vaporized.</p>

      <p>Years ago the Atlanteans had worked out emergency procedures, but most people had forgotten them. One old person remembers where the emergency instructions and equipment were kept.</p>
      <p>You and the Atlanteans work without stop for 72 hours pumping out the flooding waters and building a special retaining wall around the volcanic crack. Finally the last pump is shut off. You are all exhausted, but you've won in your battle against the sea.</p>

      <p>With everyone worried about the sea crashing in, no one will notice you if you try to escape. You run down a long, little-used corridor that leads to the sea. The exit door is heavy and rusty from not being used. You push with all your might, and finally it swings open into an airlock to the open water. You push the emergency release button and shoot out into the water. The Seeker is where you left it, and once inside, you head for the surface where the Maray waits for you.</p>
